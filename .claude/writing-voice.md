# John Ehrlinger — Writing Voice Fingerprint

Reference for keeping documentation and prose in a consistent human voice.
Canonical copy lives in the Obsidian vault; package repos hold a synced copy.

## The voice in one line

Pedagogical and conversational: start from something the reader already knows,
build to the new idea with a concrete analogy, and don't be afraid of a little
personality or a slightly imperfect sentence.

## Two registers

**Narrative** (vignettes, README, roxygen @description/@details, methods prose)
- Open from the familiar: "Most readers are familiar with simple linear regression..."
- Carry one concrete analogy through a hard idea (a fruit basket, the blind men
  and the elephant, a "noise-reduction filter").
- Question-headed sections: "Why Cluster?", "Where Do We Stop?".
- First person plural: "in our practice", "we proceed". Address the reader as "you".
- Gloss terms inline in parentheses; scare-quote a piece of jargon the first
  time it appears ("rules", "elbow", "eyeballing").
- Start sentences with But / Yet / Thus / Now when it helps the flow.
- **Conversational, not chatty.** A colleague explaining the method at a
  whiteboard, not a blog post. Keep an analogy when it teaches; cut winking
  asides and cute phrasing. "no Tukey rule hiding in the middle" is too cute;
  "not the usual Tukey 1.5 IQR whiskers" is right. Plain and direct beats
  folksy. The reader is a peer, so don't perform for them.
- Vary sentence length. A short flat statement after a long one lands well.

**Terse** (roxygen @param/@return, NEWS bullets)
- Compressed, but still plain and concrete, not sterile.
- State the thing; skip the preamble. "Logical; if TRUE, ..." not "This
  argument controls whether...".
- No analogies, no question headers here; the voice shows in word choice.

## Rules

- Em-dashes: use sparingly. Native to the voice and honestly overused. Keep one
  where it earns the pause; otherwise a comma, parentheses, or a full stop.
- Ellipses: an informal-register habit (text, email). Keep them out of package docs.
- Don't overstate. No overselling. Cut "enhanced", "powerful", "seamlessly",
  "robust" (as a brag), "comprehensive". State what the thing does, at its size.
- Imperfection is allowed. Mild redundancy, an occasional long sentence: human
  texture, not an error to scrub. Don't polish to a glassy finish.
- Repetition that teaches is voice, not defect. Restating a concept, or a
  callback structure (state the problems up front, answer each later), is kept.
  Repeat when it clarifies; cut repetition that only fills space.

## When NOT to apply this voice

This voice governs documentation *prose* — Narrative and Terse. It does not
govern:

- CRAN-facing `\value` / `@return` boilerplate, which follows R documentation
  convention, not register.
- R error, warning, and message strings, which state the condition plainly.
- Code comments, which explain the code to a maintainer, not the method to a
  reader.

When the task is one of these, ignore the registers and write to the local
convention.

## AI tells to hunt and kill

- Mechanical parallelism: same-shaped sentences with no teaching purpose, lists
  padded to equal length. (Pedagogical repetition is NOT this; preserve it.)
- Flavorlessness: correct but with no analogy, no picture, nothing a person
  would actually say.
- Missing "we"/"you": abstract, authorless prose.
- Forced tricolons: "fast, simple, and reliable".
- Hedge-free sterile balance: "X. However, Y. It is worth noting Z."
- Overstatement (see Rules).
- "in order to", "it is important to note", "leverage", "utilize".

Punctuation density is NOT a tell. The tells are structural.

## Before / after

AI:   "Set per_class = TRUE to enable the computation of per-class one-vs-rest
       ROC curves, providing enhanced flexibility for multi-class analysis."
John: "Set per_class = TRUE and a multi-class forest gives you one ROC curve
       per class, each class scored against all the others."


## Reference exemplars

Canonical samples of the voice, by register. When in doubt, read the one whose
register matches the task.

- **Plain-English explanatory** (the gold standard for teaching a method):
  `boilerplates/methods/VarPro Modeling in Plain English.docx` and
  `boilerplates/methods/supp_SIDclustering_methods.docx` (OneDrive, CORR
  Analysis Team). Opens from the familiar, carries one analogy throughout
  (fruit basket, noise-reduction filter), question-headed sections, "we"/"you",
  numbered-problems-answered-later callback.
- **Short-form announcement** (LinkedIn / release posts): the TemporalHazard
  1.0.3 LinkedIn post, below. Compresses the narrative register: familiar
  opener, one rhetorical-question hook, one carried picture, understatement,
  "we"/"you", no marketing tricolons.
- **Recipe book ("When to use it" sections)**: the Survival Plots chapter
  opener in `hvti_graphics/survival.qmd`. Narrative register aimed at a
  biostatistician reader: names the clinical question first ("how long until an
  event"), defines the one idea that makes the method its own (right-censoring),
  ties the function to the SAS macro the reader already trusts (`%kaplan`), and
  closes on how the object is used. No overstatement, "you" throughout.
- **Formal academic**: arXiv 1612.08974 and 1501.07196 (Ishwaran/Ehrlinger).
  Passive, citation-dense, no "you" — use only when the task is a methods paper.

### Short-form exemplar — TemporalHazard 1.0.3 (LinkedIn, 2026-05-29)

Why it works: familiar opener ("we know that risk is not constant"), a
rhetorical-question hook ("So why do we so often..."), one carried picture
(early/flat/late), understatement ("the usual diagnostics"), and "we"/"you"
throughout. No forced tricolon, no padded feature list, no overselling.
